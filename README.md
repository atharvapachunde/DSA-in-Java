# DSA-in-Java
This repository contains my Java solutions for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems.
Iâ€™m currently learning from [Scott Barrettâ€™s Udemy DSA course](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-java/) and will later practice LeetCode problems

---

## ðŸš€ Goal

- Master core DSA topics with hands-on Java implementations.
- Practice and implement key problems
- Build a strong foundation for placement preparation and coding interviews.
